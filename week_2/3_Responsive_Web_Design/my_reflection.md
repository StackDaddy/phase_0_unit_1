# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design is the practice of developing a design that is flexible according to the environment of the user.  For example, if the user is viewing the website on a mobile device, the website will adjust its settings to provide a better user experience.  I do like it.  I like it very much.  I definitely noticed when websites started making their sites responsive becuase it allowed me to stop wasting time zooming in and zooming out and I was able to get right to the heart of the information without having to mess around with zoom for a couple of minutes.  
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
  100 percent.  Smart phones and tablets continue to introduce new dimensions in which the users are viewing the websites.  As these technologies become more advanced, there will be an infinite amount of dimensions that web sites could potentially ajust to.  
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?  As the website mentioned, they use the web by focusing on resources that they can use, such and audio tools and other alternative sensory adjustments.  And yes, when building a website, you should target as many people as possible.  Just as every penny adds up, every viewer adds up.  
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
  The basic HTLM5 structure has resonated with me. I really like how instead of using a ton of divs we use elements such as nav, header, section, and article.  What doesn't make sense.  I am still having trouble toying with some of the CSS positioning.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
