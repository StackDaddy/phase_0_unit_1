# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM is a framework for identifying, categorizing and working with elements in HTML code.  It is pretty much like a tree structure, and each element is a node.  A lot of the javascript is still unclear, but I do understand the basic framework of it.  
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
They have significantly more ID's and Classes.  Much more links.  They also have comments which is something I have yet to use.  
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
Ha, mixed feelings, but all positive.  I think it is a very powerful tool that will aloow us to learn from others.  It also made me feel like, wow, I have a long way to go.  
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
  Just seeing the Google chome tools was definitely an aha moment.  I feel much more connected to the development process now.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
