     <h3>Definintion:</h3>

      virtually or face to face where one programmer is verbally detailing the 
      structure while the other programmer is manually crafting the code.</p>

  <p>#It was nice pairing.  It was great to be able to bounce ideas off of eachother.  What worked the best was talking out loud when you had ideas so your pair could be on the same page as you.  I found that it was also very important to be present when your pair was expressing his ideas, and not thinking about some other part of the website</p>
