# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think they are great.  I feel like it makes the web more much easier to learn about.  Especially now that we know about Chrome Dev tools, we can pull up any code and it should all be formated with the same rules.  Deffinitely easier to create a framework in my own mind for learning.  
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
  It does.  It is sort of the most broad way to define the structure of every website that I have been looking at for th elast five years.  
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
  Again, I do because for me it defined what I had been seeing for the last several years.  Also, previously to using these elemets, I had been using way too may div tags which made everything very confusing.  
* Why is reset.css necessary?
Its a standard.  Its necessary for the same reason all doctor use the metric system.  If a doctor tell one patient take 5 mg of something, it HAS to mean to same thing when another doctor tells the patient that.  Same thing with the web.  
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I've used Safari and google chrome.  I have noticed a difference, but nothing that significant.  The most subtle differences in boldness.  I don't really think its good or bad, because is it really that prcatically that we are going to get the whole world using one system.  No.  Having multiple browsers allows for people to use try applications on different frameworks.  More options.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
