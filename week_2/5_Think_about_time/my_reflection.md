# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
Allocating sufficient time.  I am trying to position myself so that money will not be an issue during the 9months in SF, so I have been working a construction job.  
* How will you combat that?
At first, I was working 5 days a week and then two days at a mountain, and it was impossible for me to get everything done.  I felt bad about quiting my job at the mountain, but I told the boss the truth of my situation, and he was somewhat understanding.  Also, I asked my weekday job boss for one less day.  He was also understanding.  
* What techniques will you try?
I'm definitely all about meditation.  But my meditation takes place while running, swimming, biking or mountain climbing.  I just try and go fast and get in the zone.  I feel pretty relaxed after a good workout.  Having a growth midset is also huge.  During my college years I was definitely guilty of having a fixed mindset at times.  
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
I think the most important thing for phase zero is to have that growth midset and spend the most time on what I DON'T know.  Be real efficient, and ask questions as often as I can.
