# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: file:///Users/ryanstack/DBC/stackdaddy.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I learned a lot.  It is still very much a work in progress however.  I learned to arrange elements using the box model.  Most importantly though, I'd like to say I learned a bit about positioning.For example, how to float elements to the left or to the right.  
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
To be honest, it was stressfull.  I spent a lot of time trying to tweak things around, and there is a lot i don't know.  So it still seemes super complicated ot me.  
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  My process was to sketch out he website and then create a general skeleton with the html and then fill in the content.  This definietly seemed to work well for rough outlines but sometimes I had trouble peositioning everything once all the content was in place.  
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to add more links to the site.  I would also like to make a lot more fixed position elements.  
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
Yes it was difficult.  There is a big difference between reading a power point and truly understanding it.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
